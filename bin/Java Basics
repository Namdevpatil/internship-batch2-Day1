Java Basics:
	- comments: //, /*....*/, /**....*/ 
		- comments are ignored by the "java compiler"
		
	- variables:
		-to store some values
		-types of variables
				- global(class/static variables and instance/non-static variables)
				- local(these variables are the part of the method/constructor/block)
	- data types:
		- to make you understand the compiler and JVM, 
		  the what type of data/value we storing in variable. 
		- data types are of two types:
				- primitive data types: stores only one value in a variable
						- int, float, char, boolean..etc
				- non-primitive data types: stores multiple values in a variable
						- arrays, strings, enum and classes
	- keywords:
		- these words are reserved words, for a specific operation in JRE.
		- we are not using these words for multiple purpose.
		
	- expressions:
			- Operands and Operators
	- operators:
			- unary: need one variable
			- binary: two variable
			- ternary: three variable
			
	- conditional statements
	- conditional loops
	- methods in java
